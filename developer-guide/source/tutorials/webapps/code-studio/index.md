# Use your own framework.

This section uses the Code Studio feature to explore Web Application Development in Dataiku.
Utilize Visual Code directly within Dataiku to develop web applications
using your preferred Javascript frameworks and libraries.
This section offers insights into practices and development techniques using prominent frameworks. 
**Two separate ways** of doing this are proposed: a basic setup based on a predefined template and
an advanced setup where you will learn how to integrate your framework.


(code-studio_index_easiest_way)=
## Basic setup

Based on an already defined code studio template and helpers to start quickly.
This example highlights VueJs(v3) and angular (v16) usage.
This is the easiest way, but it may not be suitable depending on your use case and requirements.
The tutorials in this section:

- [Basic setup: Code Studio template setup](./template/index)
- [Basic setup: Web Applications code starters](./code-starters/index)
- [Basic setup: Deployment](./deployment/index)

(code-studio_index_full_custom)=
## Advanced setup

The entire creation of the whole stack to be able to use your framework is proposed, 
and a focus is done on the angular framework.
This is a more advanced usage of Code Studio and requires the users to understand the framework they want to use.
Still, it provides the complete customization of Dataiku to adapt to your framework.
