# Dataiku API

Dataiku's public API is a powerful tool that allows you to automate various tasks
and interact programmatically with multiple components within your Dataiku instance.
By leveraging Dataiku's Python client library, users can seamlessly interact with the API, 
enabling tasks such as managing datasets, triggering workflows, and accessing project information. 
Additionally, the REST API can also be used to achieve similar functionalities. 
However, it's important to note that Dataiku strongly encourages users to leverage the Python client library due to its comprehensive functionality and ease of use.
