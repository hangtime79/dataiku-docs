Generate statistics
####################

The "generate statistics" recipes allow you to perform statistical computations about a dataset. When creating a "generate statistics" recipe in the flow, you can choose among different kinds of analyses:

* Univariate analysis
* Principal component analysis
* Statistical tests 

These computations and more are also available in :ref:`interactive mode<interactive-statistics>` using the worksheet interface in the **Statistics** tab of your dataset.

For the computations that support it, it is also possible to directly export a card from an interactive statistics worksheet to a recipe in the flow.

Details about the computations and their parameters can be found on the dedicated pages in the :ref:`interactive statistics documentation<interactive-statistics>`.
