How to Copy Scenario Steps
=================================

Existing steps in a scenario can be reused in another scenario so that you don't have to manually replicate the steps. You can also :doc:`duplicate an existing scenario </scenarios/duplicate-scenarios>` to use in a project.

Copying Steps
-------------

From within the scenario that contains the steps you want to copy:

- Right-click on the step you want to copy and select **Copy step**.
- Navigate to the scenario where you want to paste the step
- Select the step that marks where the copied step should be pasted
- Right-click on that step and select **Paste after this step**
