Writing in SQL table datasets
==============================

* You can write to SQL table datasets (external table datasets and managed SQL datasets) but not to external query datasets. See :doc:`./datasets` for more information.

Executing SQL queries
=======================

* You can write code recipes that create datasets using the results of a SQL query on existing SQL datasets. See :doc:`/code_recipes/sql` for more information about SQL recipes.

* You can also use the SQL Notebook for interactive querying.
