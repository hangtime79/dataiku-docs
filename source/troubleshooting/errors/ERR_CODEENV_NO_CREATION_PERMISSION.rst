ERR_CODEENV_NO_CREATION_PERMISSION: User not allowed to create Code environments
####################################################################################

The current user does not have permissions to create code environments.


Remediation
===========

This issue can only be fixed by a DSS administrator.

The administrator needs to give permission to that user to create code environments.
This is done at the group level, so that user needs to be put in a group that has
that permission set. See also :doc:`/security/permissions`.
