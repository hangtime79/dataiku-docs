ERR_PLUGIN_NOT_INSTALLED: Plugin not installed or removed
############################################################

A plugin has been removed from the instance

Remediation
===========

The plugin has been removed so there are 2 cases:

* the removal is intentional: the browser's page need to be refreshed
* the removal is not intentional : this issue can only be fixed by a DSS administrator, either by reinstalling the plugin or by reverting the plugins/dev to a previous state.
