WARN_PROJECT_LARGE_STREAMING_HISTORY: Projects - Too old or too many continuous activities logs
###############################################################################################

There are projects in your Dataiku instance that have too many continuous activities logs (more than 1000) or that have continuous activities logs that are too old (60+ days-old). This can cause performance issues and fills up your disk space.

Remediation
===========

Manually delete the continuous activities logs or run the **Clear continuous activities logs** macro.
