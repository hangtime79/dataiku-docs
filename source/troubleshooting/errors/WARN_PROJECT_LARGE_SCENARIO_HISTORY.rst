WARN_PROJECT_LARGE_SCENARIO_HISTORY: Projects - Too old or too many scenario run logs
#####################################################################################

There are projects in your Dataiku instance that have too many scenario runs logs (more than 1000) or that have scenario runs logs that are too old (60+ days-old). This can cause performance issues and fills up your disk space.

Remediation
===========

Manually delete the scenario runs logs or run the **Clear scenario runs logs** macro.
