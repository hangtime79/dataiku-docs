ERR_CODEENV_JUPYTER_SUPPORT_INSTALL_FAILED: Could not install Jupyter support in this code environment
######################################################################################################

The installation of Jupyter support in the code environment failed.

You may still be able to use the code environment in code recipes or for Visual ML,
but you won't be able to use it in Jupyter notebooks.

Remediation
===========

You can find the logs of the installation either in the code environment creation/update window,
or in the code environment logs. If you or your IT administrator cannot resolve the error
from the logs, you can send those logs to Dataiku support.
