ERR_CONNECTION_SSH_INVALID_CONFIG: Invalid SSH connection configuration
##########################################################################

DSS tried to connect to the SSH server but the configuration seems invalid.


Remediation
===========

This issue can only be fixed by a DSS administrator.

The first step for solving this issue is to go to the settings screen for the affected connection (Administration > Connections). You can test the connection from there.

* Refer to the :doc:`documentation on SCP / SFTP (aka SSH) </connecting/scp-sftp>` in order to get additional information
* Make sure that the connection settings are correct
