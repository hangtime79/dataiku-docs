WARN_PROJECT_LARGE_JOB_HISTORY: Projects - Too old or too many job logs
#######################################################################

There are projects in your Dataiku instance that have too many job logs (more than 1000) or that have job logs that are too old (60+ days-old). This can cause performance issues and fills up your disk space.

Remediation
===========

Manually delete the job logs or run the **Clear job logs** macro.
