ERR_CONNECTION_SQL_INVALID_CONFIG: Invalid SQL connection configuration
##########################################################################

DSS tried to connect to a SQL database but the configuration seems invalid.

Remediation
===========

This issue can only be fixed by a DSS administrator

The first step for solving this issue is to go to the settings screen for the affected connection (Administration > Connections). You can test the connection from there.

* Refer to the :doc:`documentation on SQL databases </connecting/sql/index>` in order to get additional information on the support of your specific database by DSS.
* Make sure that the connection settings are correct
