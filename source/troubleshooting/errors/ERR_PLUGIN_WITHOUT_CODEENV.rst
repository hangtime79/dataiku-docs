ERR_PLUGIN_WITHOUT_CODEENV: The plugin has no code env specification
##########################################################################

The user has requested the update of the code env of a plugin, but no code env is setup for that plugin.


Remediation
===========

This issue can only be fixed by a DSS administrator.

A code env for the plugin needs to be created first, by going to the Administration > Plugins list and setuping the plugins dependencies.

See also the :doc:`documentation on Code environments </code-envs/index>`.
