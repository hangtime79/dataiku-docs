ERR_BUNDLE_ACTIVATE_CONNECTION_NOT_WRITABLE: Connection is not writable
#######################################################################

The project you are trying to import/duplicate contains dataset(s) located on read only connection(s).

Remediation
===========

Use the connection remapping option, and map the read only connection(s) to one you have write permission to.
The connection remapping is available for both project import (tick the ``Display advanced options after upload``) or project duplication (under the ``Advanced options`` menu).
