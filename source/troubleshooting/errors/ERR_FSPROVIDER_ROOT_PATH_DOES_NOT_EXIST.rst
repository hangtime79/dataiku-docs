ERR_FSPROVIDER_ROOT_PATH_DOES_NOT_EXIST: Root path of the dataset or folder does not exist
############################################################################################################

The root path of the dataset or folder does not exist.
DSS is trying to access data that is not there.


Remediation
===========

Check the settings of the dataset or managed folder. The error message details
what path was not found in the connection. You may need the assistance of someone
with write access to that storage to create the folder for you.

In some cases, the configuration issue can be at the connection level, in which case it must be fixed by your DSS administrator.
