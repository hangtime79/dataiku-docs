ERR_FSPROVIDER_PATH_DOES_NOT_EXIST: Path in dataset or folder does not exist
####################################################################################

The specified path in the dataset or folder does not exist.
This can happen if a partition is required but does not exist.


Remediation
===========

Check the settings of the dataset or managed folder. The error message details what path was not found.

In some cases, the configuration issue can be at the connection level, in which case it must be fixed by your DSS administrator.
