Requirements
=============

.. note::

	We recommend using Dataiku Cloud Stacks, which fulfills all Code Studios requirements out of the box.

In order to use Code Studios:

* :doc:`/containers/index` must be fully setup (which includes having a containerized execution config, having the ability to build images and push them to the registry, and having a cluster defined)
* Your ``kubectl`` version should be at least 1.23.
