Exploring data
####################

Once you have defined a dataset, the first thing that DSS allows you to do is to view your data in the "Explore" component.

Explore shows you :doc:`a sample <sampling>` of your dataset. It also provides:

* Quick descriptive statistics, either on the sample on the entirety of the data
* Meanings, i.e. rich types. See :doc:`/schemas/index` for more information
* An overview of all columns
* The ability to sort and filter the sample
* The ability to choose which columns are displayed

All these abilities are also available while :doc:`doing visual preparation </preparation/index>` of your data.

.. note::

	For an introduction to the exploration component of Data Science Studio, we recommend that you first consult the `Knowledge Base <https://knowledge.dataiku.com/latest/data-sourcing/datasets/index.html>`_.
