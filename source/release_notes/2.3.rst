DSS 2.3.0 is a major upgrade to DSS with exciting improvements.

For a summary of the major new features, see: https://www.dataiku.com/learn/whatsnew

New features
-------------

Visual data preparation, reloaded
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Our visual data preparation component is a major focus of DSS 2.3, with numerous large improvements:

* You can now group, color and comment all script steps

* It is now possible to color the cells of the data table by their values, to easily locate co-occurences, or columns changing together.

* The Python and Formula editors are now much easier to use.

* The Formula language has been strongly enriched, making it a very powerful, but still very easy to use tool. See :doc:`/formula/index` and our new Howto for more information.

* The Quick Column View provides an immediate overview of all columns, and allows you to navigate very simply across columns.

* The header at the top of the table now always precisely tells you what you are seing and the impact of your preparation on your data.

* Many processors are now multi-column able, including the ability to select all columns, or all columns matching a pattern.

* It is now possible to temporarily hide some columns

* Hit Shift+V to view "long" values in a data table cell, including JSON formatting and folding

* The redesigned UI makes it much clearer to navigate your preparation steps and data table.

Schemas edition and user-defined meanings
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

If it now possible to edit the schemas of datasets directly in the Exploration screen.

You can now define your own meanings, either declaratively, through values lists or through patterns. User-defined meanings are available everywhere you need them, bringing easy documentation to your data projects. For more informations, see :doc:`/schemas/index`

Data Catalog
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Since the very first versions, DSS let you search within your project. Thanks to the new Data Catalog, you now have an extremely powerful instance-wide search. Even if you have dozens of projects, you'll be able to find easily all DSS objects, with deep search (search a dataset by column name, a recipe by comments in the code, ...).

The Data Catalog provides a faceted search and fully respects applicative security.

Flow tools and views
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The new Flow views system is an advanced productivity tool, especially designed for large projects. It provides additional "layers" onto the Flow:

* Color by tag name and easily propagate tags
* Recursively check and propagate schema changes across a Flow
* Check the consistency of datasets and recipes across a project.

New SQL / Hive / Impala notebook
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The SQL / Hive / Impala notebook now features a "multi-cells" mechanism that lets you work on several queries at once, without having to juggle several notebooks or search endlessly in the history.

You can also now add comments and descriptions, to transform your SQL notebooks into real data stories.

Contextual help
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

* DSS now includes helper tooltips to guide you through the UI
* The Help menu now features a contextual search in our documentation

Other notable enhancements
--------------------------
