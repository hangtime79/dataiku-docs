=====================================

*This release is dedicated to the memory of our dear colleague Mark Treveil*.

DSS 10.0.0 is a major upgrade to DSS with major new features.

New features
-------------

MLOps: Models Comparison and Drift Analysis
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

:doc:`Model evaluations </mlops/model-evaluations/index>` now allow you to capture the performance and behavior of a model after it has been trained, in order to analyze the evolution of its behavior in time. This enables :doc:`/mlops/drift-analysis/index`.

:doc:`Visual model comparisons </mlops/model-comparisons/index>` allow you to quickly compare models between them or different versions of models. They can be used both during the Machine Learning design phase or to compare behaviors and performance over time.

For more details, please see :doc:`/mlops/index`

MLOps: Centralized Models registry
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Part of the new :doc:`Govern Node </governance/index>`, the centralized models registry provides a centralized way to see all models (whether developed in Dataiku or externally) in one place, versioned and with performance metrics and project summaries for leaders and project managers. This includes :doc:`Drift analysis metrics </mlops/drift-analysis/index>`

MLOps: Models deployment signoff workflows
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Part of the new :doc:`Govern Node </governance/index>`, you can now have mandatory sign-off and approval of models before they can be deployed in production. Models signoff can include multiple and customizable reviewers and approvers.

MLOps: MLflow Models import
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


DSS can now import models from the MLflow Models framework. MLFLow Models imported into DSS benefit from all the capabilities of DSS-trained models, including:

* Scoring datasets using a :ref:`scoring recipe <explanations_scoring_recipe_label>`
* Deploying the model for real-time scoring, using the :doc:`API node </apinode/index>`
* Managing multiple versions of the models
* Evaluating the performance of the model on a labeled dataset, including all results screens
* Comparing multiple models or multiple versions of the model, using :doc:`Model Comparisons </mlops/model-comparisons/index>`
* Analyzing performance and evaluating models :doc:`on other datasets </mlops/model-evaluations/index>`
* :doc:`Analyzing drift </mlops/drift-analysis/index>` on the MLflow model
* Interactive scoring, including counterfactuals and actionable recourse
* :doc:`Governing the MLflow model using the Govern Node </governance/index>`

For more details, please see :doc:`/mlops/mlflow-models/index`


Governance: Projects governance, risk & value assessments
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Part of the new :doc:`Govern Node </governance/index>`, the centralized projects governance framework leaders and project managers to keep an eye of all of the AI initiatives lifecycle with clear steps and gates in order to keep proper oversight of your business initiatives.

Risk and value assessment matrices provide a standardized framework to compare initiatives for investment and determine the appropriate oversight level.

For more details, please see :doc:`/governance/index`

Data consumers: Workspaces, a new home for data consumers
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Outputs of complex data projects are often scattered across multiple projects and locations, making it challenging for business stakeholders and data consumers to quickly gain access to the needed data.

Workspaces provide dedicated, secure landing pages where data consumers can easily browse Dataiku dashboards, webapps, datasets, applications, wikis, etc. to get direct access to the most relevant insight or to take direct action using applications and webapps.

For more details, please see :doc:`/workspaces/index`

Data consumers: cross-chart filters on dashboards
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

You can now add cross-charts filters on dashboards. The filter can affect all charts on a slide.

For more details, please see :doc:`/dashboards/concepts`

Geospatial analytics: Geo-join recipe
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The new geo-join recipe allow you to visually match and enrich geospatial datasets.

For more details, please see :doc:`/other_recipes/geojoin`

Geospatial analytics: Density chart
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The Geo heatmap chart provides a "density"-based analytics in order to quickly visualize the most important locations on a map.

Geospatial analytics: preparation tools
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

New tools in the prepare recipe facilitate Geospatial analytics:

* New processor and formula function: Create an area around a geopoint
* Formula function: Simplify a geometry (including SQL support for PostGIS and Snowflake)
* Formula function: Get the bounding box of a geometry
* Formula function: Compute distance between geometries
* Formula function: Check for intersection between geometries
* The Change CRS processor can now run in SQL (with PostGIS)

Machine Learning: Object detection
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Object detection is now a top-level task in DSS. You can now easily leverage leading, pre-trained deep learning models for detecting objects, and fine tune them to your specific labeled datasets.

Like all models trained visually in DSS, object detection models provide detailed results screens, builtin scoring ability, versioning and governance.

For more details, please see :doc:`/machine-learning/computer-vision/index`


Machine Learning: Counterfactuals and Actionable Recourse
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Counterfactuals and Actionable Recourse analysis enhance :doc:`/machine-learning/supervised/interactive-scoring` with insights about the behavior of the model in the vicinity of a reference example.

Counterfactuals generate various records similar to the reference example and that lead to a different predicted class.

Actionable recourse generates the records with the smallest possible perturbations compared to the reference example that lead to a specific predicted class, different from the one of the reference example.
Interactive scoring is a simulator that enables any AI builder or consumer to run “what-if” analyses (i.e., qualitative sensibility analyses)


Machine Learning: LightGBM
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The fast and powerful LightGBM algorithm joins the family of algorithms that can be trained by the DSS AutoML component

Machine Learning: expanded feature encodings
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Several new feature encodings are now available in AutoML:

* Enhanced impact (target) encoding
* Rank encoding
* Frequency encoding
* Cyclical encodings for date/time

For more details, please see :doc:`/machine-learning/features-handling/index`

Machine Learning: Queues
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

While training machine learning models, you can now enqueue several trainings that will all execute without further intervention. This allows you to schedule many experiments at the end of the day, and come back the next day with all your models trained and ready to :doc:`be compared in the new Models Comparison </mlops/model-comparisons/index>`.


Statistics: Augmented Exploratory Data Analysis
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

When performing exploratory data analysis on wide or complex datasets, it can be challenging and overwhelming for users to understand which columns might be most important to their analysis, how the columns relate to each other, and to identify patterns and insights.

Within the Statistics, a new wizard interactively suggests statistical analyses that may be interesting, along with new additional advanced charting capabilities such as 3-D scatter plots and parallel coordinates plots.

Other notable enhancements
-----------------------------

Charts: Customizable axis ranges
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Ranges on both the X and Y axis of charts can now be customized

Charts: Color assignments
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

It is now easier to manually control color assignments on charts in order to have consistent colors between charts.

Charts: numerical formatting
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

New numerical formatting options are available for charts (for values displayed in the chart and in the tooltips)

Git push and pull for libraries
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In addition to the existing capability to fetch project libraries from existing Git repositories, it is now possible to push them back to their origin.

For more details, please see :doc:`/collaboration/import-code-from-git`

.. _code-env-resources-v-10.0:

Code env resources
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

When installing some packages in code envs, such as NLTK or Spacy, you frequently need to download additional resources, such as pretrained models. Previously, each user had to download the resource in a specific folder, and sometimes tweak options of the packages in order to point to the downloaded resources.

Code env resources allow you to download resources directly to the code env folder, making them available for all users

For more details, please see :doc:`/code-envs/operations-python`

Data preparation: Easy extraction with Grok 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

You can now leverage the "Grok" pattern extraction mechanism that allows you to easily parse logs using predefined patterns. A visual editor makes it easy to view what your expression matches and to troubleshoot it.

For more details, please see :doc:`/preparation/processors/grok`

Wiki: quality-of-life enhancements
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

It is now possible to attach images in the wiki by directly dragging and dropping it.

Adding attachments does not require saving edits first anymore.
