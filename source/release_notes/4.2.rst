How to upgrade
----------------

It is strongly recommended that you perform a full backup of your DSS data directory prior to starting the upgrade procedure.

For automatic upgrade information, see :doc:`/installation/custom/upgrade`.

Pay attention to the warnings described in :ref:`releases_notes.4.2.limitations`.

Limitations and warnings
--------------------------

DSS 4.2 is a major release, which changes some underlying workings of DSS. Automatic migration from previous versions is supported, but there are a few points that need manual attention.


Retrain of machine-learning models
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

* Models trained with prior versions of DSS should be retrained when upgrading to 4.2 (usual limitations on retraining models and regenerating API node packages - see :doc:`/installation/custom/upgrade`). This includes models deployed to the flow (re-run the training recipe), models in analysis (retrain them before deploying) and API package models (retrain the flow saved model and build a new package)

* After installation of the new version, R setup must be replayed

External libraries upgrades
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Several external libraries bundled with DSS have been bumped to major revisions. Some of these libraries include some changes that may require adaptation of your code.

As usual, remember that you should not change the version of Python libraries bundled with DSS. Instead, use :doc:`/code-envs/index`.

Version 4.2.0 - March, 21st 2018
=====================================

DSS 4.2.0 is a major upgrade to DSS with significant new features. For a summary of the major new features, see: https://www.dataiku.com/learn/whatsnew

New features
-------------

Support for sample weights in visual machine learning
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

You can now define a column to be used as the sample weights column when training a machine-learning model.

When a sample weights column is enabled:

* Most algorithms take it into account for training
* All performance metrics become weighted metrics for better evaluation of your model's performance

"Hive" dataset (views and decimal support)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In addition to the traditional "HDFS" dataset, DSS now supports a native "Hive" dataset.

When reading a "Hive" dataset, DSS uses HiveServer2 to access its data (compared to the direct access to the underlying HDFS files, with the traditional HDFS dataset).

This gives access to some Hive-native features that were not possible with the HDFS dataset:

* Support for Hive views (including if you don't have filesystem access to the underlying tables)
* Support for ACID Hive tables
* Better support for "decimal" and "date" data types

The Hive dataset can be used in all visual recipes in addition to the coding Hive recipe.

When importing tables from the Hive metastore, you can now select whether to import it as a HDFS or Hive dataset.

Impersonation on SQL databases
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

When running DSS in multi-user-security mode (see :doc:`/user-isolation/index`), you can now use impersonation features of some enterprise databases.

This gives per-user impersonation when logging into the database (i.e. connections to the database are made as the final user, not as the DSS service account), without requiring users to individually enter and store their connection credentials.

This feature is available for:

* :doc:`Microsoft SQL Server </connecting/sql/sqlserver>` (also added: Kerberos authentication support)
* :doc:`Oracle  </connecting/sql/oracle>` (also added: Kerberos authentication support)


Full support for BigQuery
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

DSS now supports both read and write for Google BigQuery

Dedicated automation homepage
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Automation nodes now get a dedicated home page that shows the state of all of your scenarios.

API for managing and training machine-learning models
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

All machine learning models operations can now be performed using the API, and we provide a Python client for this:

* Creating models
* Modifying their settings
* Training them
* Retrieving details of trained models
* Deploying trained models to DSS Flow
* Creating scoring recipes

See :doc:`devguide:api-reference/python/index`
