Version 9.0.0 - March 1st, 2021
=====================================

DSS 9.0.0 is a major upgrade to DSS with major new features.

New features
-------------

Unified Deployer
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The :doc:`DSS Deployer </deployment/index>` provides a unified environment for fully-managed production deployments of both projects and API services. It allows you to have a central view of all of your production assets, to manage CI/CD pipelines with testing/preproduction/production stages, and is fully API-drivable.

For more details, please see :doc:`/deployment/index`.

Interactive scoring and What-if
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Interactive scoring is a simulator that enables any AI builder or consumer to run “what-if” analyses (i.e., qualitative sensibility analyses) to get a better understanding of what impact changing a given feature value has on the prediction by displaying in real time the resulting prediction and the individual prediction explanations. 

For more details, please see :doc:`/machine-learning/supervised/interactive-scoring`.

Dash Webapps
%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Dash by Plotly is a framework for easily building rich web applications. DSS now includes the ability to write, deploy and manage Dash webapps. Dash joins Flask, Bokeh and Shiny as webapps building frameworks to help data scientists go much further than simple dashboards and provide full interactivity to users.

For more details, please see :doc:`/webapps/dash`.

Fuzzy join recipe
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

A very frequent data wrangling use case is to join datasets with "almost equal" data. The new "fuzzy join" recipe is dedicated to joins between two datasets when join keys don't match exactly. It handles inner, left, right and outer fuzzy joins, and handles text, numerical and geographic fuzziness.

For more details, please see :doc:`/other_recipes/fuzzy-join`


Smart Pattern Builder
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In Data Preparation, you can now highlight a part of a cell in order to automatically generate suggestions to extract information "similar" to the one you highlighted. You can then add other examples to guide the automated pattern builder of DSS, and choose the pattern that provides you with the best results.

.. TODO: link

Visual ML Diagnostics
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

ML Diagnostics help you detect common pitfalls while training models, such as overfitting, leakage, insufficient learning and such. It can suggest possible improvements.

For more details, please see :doc:`/machine-learning/diagnostics`

Model assertions
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Model assertions streamline and accelerate the model evaluation process, by automatically checking that predictions for specified subpopulations meet certain conditions. You can automatically compare "expected predictions" on segments of your test data with the model's output. DSS will check that the model's predictions are aligned with your business judgment.

For more details, please see :doc:`/machine-learning/supervised/ml-assertions`


Distributed Hyperparameters Search
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

It is now possible to distribute the training of a single model over multiple containers. Dataiku will automatically distribute all the points of the hyperparameter search. The distribution happens transparently, leveraging Kubernetes. No additional setup is required.

Distributed hyperparamter search permits vastly increased depth and precision of hyperparameter search while keeping an acceptable time for training.

.. TODO: link

Git push and pull for notebooks
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

It is now possible to fetch Jupyter notebooks from existing Git repositories, and to push them back to their origin. Pulls and pushes can be made notebook-per-notebook or for a group of notebooks.

For more details, please see :doc:`/collaboration/import-notebooks-from-git`

Wiki Export
%%%%%%%%%%%%

Wikis can now be exported to PDF, either on a per-article basis or globally.

For more details, please see :doc:`/collaboration/wiki`

Model Fairness report
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Evaluating the fairness of machine learning models has been a topic of both academic and business interest in recent years. Before prescribing any resolution to the problem of model bias, it is crucial to learn more about how biased a model is, by measuring some fairness metrics. The model fairness report provides you with assistance in this measurement task.

For. more details, please see :doc:`/machine-learning/supervised/model-fairness-report`

Streaming (experimental)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

DSS now features an experimental real-time processing framework, notably targeting Kafka and Spark Structured Streaming.

For more details, please see :doc:`/streaming/index`

Delta Lake reading (experimental)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

DSS now features experimental support for directly reading the latest version of Delta Lake datasets.

For more details, please see :doc:`/connecting/formats/deltalake`

Other notable enhancements
---------------------------

Azure Synapse support
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

DSS now officially supports Azure Synapse (dedicated SQL pools)

For more details, please see :doc:`/connecting/sql/synapse`

Date Preparation
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

DSS brings a lot of new capabilities for date preparation:

* New visual prepare processors for incrementing or truncating dates, and for finding differences between dates
* New ability to delete, keep or flag rows based on various time intervals
* Better date filtering capabilities for Explore view

For more details, please see :doc:`/preparation/dates`

Formula editor
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The formula editor has been strongly enhanced with better code completion, inline help for all functions and features, and better examples.

For more details, please see :doc:`/formula/index`

Spark 3
%%%%%%%%

DSS now supports Spark 3.

If using :doc:`Dataiku Cloud Stacks for AWS </installation/cloudstacks-aws/index>` or :doc:`Elastic AI for Spark </containers/index>`, Spark 3 is builtin.

It is also now possible to use ``SparkSession`` in Pyspark code 

Python 3.7
%%%%%%%%%%%

DSS now supports Python 3.7

You can now create Python 3.7 code envs. In addition, on Linux distributions where Python 3.7 is the default, DSS will automatically use it.

In addition, new DSS setups will now use Python 3.6 or Python 3.7 as the default builtin environment.

In Python 3.7, ``async`` is promoted to a reserved keyword and thus cannot be used as a keyword argument in a method or a function anymore. As a consequence, the DSS ``Scenario`` API is replacing the ``async`` keyword argument, formerly used in some methods, by the ``asynchronous`` keyword argument. Please make sure to update uses of the ``Scenario`` class accordingly if running Python scenarios or Python scenario steps with Python 3.7.

Impacted methods are: ``run_scenario``, ``run_step``, ``build_dataset``, ``build_folder``, ``train_model``, ``invalidate_dataset_cache``, ``clear_dataset``, ``clear_folder``, ``run_dataset_checks``, ``compute_dataset_metrics``, ``synchronize_hive_metastore``, ``update_from_hive_metastore``, ``execute_sql``, ``set_project_variables``, ``set_global_variables``, ``run_global_variables_update``, ``create_jupyter_export``, ``package_api_service``.

Builtin Snowflake driver
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

DSS now comes with the Snowflake JDBC driver and native Spark connector builtin. You do not need to install JDBC drivers for Snowflake anymore.

Enhanced "time-based" trigger
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The time-based trigger in scenario has been strongly enhanced with the following capabilities:

* Ability to show and handle triggering times in all timezones, not only server timezone
* Ability to run every X hours instead of only every hour
* Ability to run every X days instead of only every day
* Ability to run every X week instead of only every week
* Ability to run every X months instead of only every month
* For once every X month triggers, ability to run on "last Monday" or "third Tuesday"
* Ability to set a starting date for a trigger

Enhanced cross-connection and no-input SQL recipes
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

SQL recipes can now work without an input dataset. The recipe will run in the connection of the output dataset.

For SQL recipes with both inputs and outputs, it is now possible to enable "cross-connection" handling while using
the connection of the output (previously, only inputs could be selected).

Addition of individual users to projects
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

You can now grant access to projects to individual users, in addition to groups.

Pan/Zoom control in Flow
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

You can now zoom and pan on the flow with the keyboard, and zoom and reset the zoom with dedicated buttons.

Variables expansion support in "Build" 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The "Build" dialog now supports variables expansion for partitioned datasets

Variables expansion support in "Explicit values" 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The "Explicit Values" partition dependency function now supports variables expansion

Schema reload and propagation as scenario steps
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In many situations, it is expected that the schema of a Flow input dataset will change frequently, and that these
changes should be accepted and their impacts propagated without further manual intervention.

In order to ease the situations, DSS 9 introduces two new scenario steps:

* "Reload dataset schema" to reload the schema of an input dataset from the underlying data source
* "Propagate schema" to perform an automated schema propagation across the Flow.

These steps should usually be used before a recursive Build step.

Experimental read support for kdb+
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Dataiku now features experimental support for reading from :doc:`/connecting/kdbplus`
