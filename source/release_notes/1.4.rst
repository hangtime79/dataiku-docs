Version 1.4.0 - January 13th, 2015
======================================

Important notes about migration
-----------------------------------

The automatic data migration procedure is documented in :doc:`/installation/custom/upgrade`

As usual, we **strongly recommend** that you perform a full backup of your Data Science Studio data directory prior to starting the upgrade procedure.

Automatic migration of data from Data Science Studio 1.3.X is supported, with the following restrictions and warnings:

* The "dip.flow.activities.nthreads" parameter in dip.properties has been removed. Setting the number of activities is now done in the Administration pages (Settings > Build).
* Referencing a dip.properties entry from a FS dataset path is not possible anymore. Use the variables expansion system.

For migrations from Data Science Studio 1.2.X, please also see the release notes of version 1.3.0

New features
-------------

Mac OS X
%%%%%%%%%%

* DSS is now available on Mac OS X (10.9 and above).

 * Note that the OS X version is only available for experimentation and evaluation purpose, it is not supported for production usage
 * Download and install Mac OS X version from: http://www.dataiku.com/dss/editions/community-download/

Security
%%%%%%%%%%%

* You can now connect DSS to your corporate LDAP directory and use your LDAP users and groups to control access to DSS.
  See :doc:`/security/authentication/ldap`.

* DSS can now interact with Kerberos-enabled Hadoop clusters
  See :doc:`/hadoop/secure-clusters`.

Visual data preparation
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

* Transformation recipes created with the visual data preparation tool can now fully run on a Hadoop cluster. See :doc:`/preparation/engines`

* BETA feature: geo processing processors (see :doc:`/preparation/geographic`)

 * Reverse geocoding (from GPS coordinates to city / region / country)
 * Zipcode-based geocoding (from zipcode to GPS coordinates)


Data Visualization
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

* You can now export charts built with DSS as Excel documents for easy embedding

* Several color palettes are now available for charts. Furthermore, you can add custom color palettes

* BETA feature: geo charts (see :doc:`/visualization/charts-maps`)

 * Geo charts allow you to aggregate a dataset based on a column containing geo coordinates.
 * Aggregation is made by administrative boundaries (city / region / country)

New data transformation recipes
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

* "Grouping" recipe: new visual tool to perform grouping and aggregations (sum, avg, first, last, ...)

 * Multi-key grouping and multi-aggregations
 * Integrated filtering
 * Automatically runs in-database or on-Hadoop when possible.

* "Split" recipe: split one input dataset into several output datasets based on the value of a column or advanced rules

Datasets
%%%%%%%%%

* Support for GeoJSON files
* Support for ESRI Shapefiles

Collaboration
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

* DSS now detects and warns when several users are working on the same dataset or recipe at the same time.
* Edit conflicts are automatically detected and avoided

Advanced usage
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

* New :doc:`/variables/index` system that allows you to use some shared and reusable variables in several parts of the Studio.

* You can now write custom Python code for advanced partition dependencies in Flow. See :doc:`/partitions/dependencies`

* The number of concurrent running activities (builds of a partition) can now be set:

 * per-job
 * per-connection
 * globally

* A command-line tool lets you mass-import all (or selected) tables of a Hive database as DSS datasets. See :doc:`/hadoop/hive`

Other enhancements
--------------------

Flow
%%%%

* When aborting a job, DSS tries to cancel running SQL queries and running Hadoop jobs
* Performance improvements for computing partition dependencies on large flows

* New processor to duplicate a column
* New processors for advanced processing of complex content (JSON arrays and objects)

* "Live processing" charts can now work on a set of partitions

Web apps
%%%%%%%%%%

* Better syntax highlighting in the JS editor
* Code folding in all code editors

Data visualization
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

* MIN and MAX are now available as aggregations in charts
* Legend can now be hidden
* Smoothing of lines and areas can now be disabled
