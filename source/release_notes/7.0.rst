How to upgrade
----------------

It is strongly recommended that you perform a full backup of your DSS data directory prior to starting the upgrade procedure.

For automatic upgrade information, see :doc:`/installation/custom/upgrade`.

Pay attention to the warnings described in :ref:`releases_notes.7.0.limitations`.


.. _releases_notes.7.0.limitations:


Limitations and warnings
--------------------------

Automatic migration from previous versions (see above) is supported, but there are a few points that need manual attention.

Fix for typed variables in Python
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In DSS 5.1 and 6.0, a regression affected `dataiku.get_custom_variables(typed=True)`. This regression was fixed in DSS 7.0, so variables typing will be restored. This may affect workarounds that you may have setup in order to work around the regression.

"origin" as remote name
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

DSS 7.0 introduces a new Git integration for projects, with vastly enhanced features like multiple branches and pulling from Git remotes.

In order to introduce this, DSS 7.0 also introduces a unified name for Git remotes. DSS will now only consider the remote named "origin" (the "standard" Git naming). As a result, if you had already added Git remotes with a different name, you may need to re-add it to your projects, following the instructions in :doc:`/collaboration/version-control`.


Deprecation notice
-------------------

DSS 7.0 deprecates support for some features and versions. Support for these will be removed in a later release.

* Support for "Hive CLI" execution modes for Hive is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. We recommend that you switch to HiveServer2. Please note that "Hive CLI" execution modes are already incompatible with User Isolation Framework.

* Support for Microsoft HDInsight is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release. We recommend that users plan a migration toward a Kubernetes-based infrastructure.

* Support for Machine Learning through Vertica Advanced Analytics is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release. We recommend that you switch to In-memory based machine learning models. In-database scoring of in-memory-trained machine learnings will remain available.

* Support for Hive SequenceFile and RCFile formats is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

* As a reminder from 6.0, support for Spark 1 (1.6) is deprecated. We strongly advise you to migrate to Spark 2. All Hadoop distributions can use Spark 2. Support for Spark 1 will be removed in DSS 8

* As a reminder from 6.0, support for Pig is deprecated. We strongly advise you to migrate to Spark.

Version 7.0.0 - March, 2nd, 2020
=====================================

DSS 7.0.0 is a major upgrade to DSS with major new features.

New features
-------------

Interactive statistics
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Dataiku DSS now features a dedicated interface for performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on datasets. EDA is useful for analyzing datasets and summarizing their main characteristics. Common tasks in EDA include visual data exploration, statistical testing, detecting correlations, and dimensionality reduction.

Some of the features of interactive statistics in Dataiku DSS are:

* Univariate analysis (descriptive statistics, histograms, boxplots, quantile tables, frequency tables, cross-filter, ...)
* Bivariate analysis (scatter plots, correlation analysis, bivariate frequency tables, ...)
* Statistical tests (mean tests, distribution tests, two-sample tests, Anova, Chi-Square, ...)
* Distribution fitting (normal, beta, exponential, mixtures, ...)
* Kernel Density Estimations
* Curves fitting
* Multi-variables correlation matrix
* Principal component analysis
* Arbitrary grouping and filtering

For more details, please see :doc:`/statistics/index`

Row-level interpretability
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Dataiku DSS now includes row-level interpretability for Machine Learning models. This allows you to get a detailed explanation of why a Dataiku model made a given prediction, even when said model is a "black-box" model.

Dataiku DSS features two computation methods for row-level intepretability:

* ICE (individual conditional explanations)
* Shapley values

In the model results screen, you can directly view explanations for the "most extreme" predictions on the test set. You can also compute explanations on a complete dataset in the scoring recipe.

For more details, please see :doc:`/machine-learning/supervised/explanations`

Git integration of projects: pulling and branching
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The per-project Git integration now features several key additional features:

* Pulling changes from a remote repository
* Creating branches and switching branches
* Creating new branches as new projects to work on multiple branches simultaneously

For more details, please see :doc:`/collaboration/version-control`

Fetch path and partition information in prepare recipe
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The prepare recipe now includes a new processor "Enrich with context information" that can be used to add, for each row, information about the source file and source partition.

This processor is especially useful when using partitioned-by-files datasets where the file path may contain important semantic information, that was previously not retrievable.

This processor only works in the "DSS" engine for prepare (i.e. it cannot be used with Spark).

For more details, please see :doc:`/preparation/processors/enrich-with-record-context`

Project creation macros
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Many administrators wish to have more control on how projects are created. Examples of use cases include forcing a default code env, container runtime config, automatically creating a new code env, setting up authorizations, setting up UIF settings, creating a Hive database, ...

This led many administrators to deny project creation to users, leading to higher administrative burden for administrators.

With project creation macros, administrators can delegate the creation of projects to users, but the project will be created using administrator-controlled code, in order to perform additional actions or setup.

For more details, please see :doc:`/concepts/projects/creating-through-macros`

Other notable enhancements
---------------------------

Resize columns
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

It is now possible to resize columns in the Explore and Prepare views.

Retry in scenarios
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

It is now possible to confiure each scenario step to retry a given number of times, with a configurable delay between retries.

Signing of SAML requests
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Dataiku DSS now supports signing SAML requests, for the cases where the SAML IdP requires it.

OAuth flow and credentials for plugins
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Plugins can now leverage a new infrastructure that allows their users to store per-user credentials, and to perform OAuth flows.

This is particularly useful for plugins that need to connect to OAuth-protected data sources. With this new infrastructure, your plugin can allow each user to access his own data after performing the OAuth authentication flow through DSS.

For more details, please see :doc:`/plugins/reference/params`

Merge folders recipe
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

A new visual recipe to merge the content of multiple managed folders into one "stacked" managed folder

Reload button on notebooks
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The Jupyter notebook UI now features a "Force reload" button that performs the full-unload-and-reload of the notebook that is needed:

* If the project libraries were modified and need to be reloaded
* If the DSS backend had restarted and the notebook can't authenticate anymore
* If the Hadoop delegation tokens had expired

Scalable webapps on Kubernetes
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Webapps can now be deployed on Kubernetes. This allows having multiple backends serving a webapp.

Advanced Kubernetes exposition
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Exposing API services and webapps on Kubernetes now support more advanced exposition options and custom YAML for expositions, allowing for more flexibility in advanced Kubernetes deployments.

Other enhancements and fixes
-----------------------------
