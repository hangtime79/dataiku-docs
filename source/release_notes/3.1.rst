Migration notes
================

Migration paths to DSS 3.1
----------------------------

	* From DSS 3.0: Automatic migration is supported, with the following restrictions and warnings

	* From DSS 2.X: In addition to the following restrictions and warnings, you need to pay attention
	  to the restrictions and warnings applying to your previous versions: see :doc:`2.0 -> 2.1 </release_notes/2.1>` :doc:`2.1 -> 2.2 </release_notes/2.2>` :doc:`2.2 -> 2.3 </release_notes/2.3>`
	  :doc:`2.3 -> 3.0 </release_notes/3.0>`

	* Migration from DSS 1.X is not supported. You must first upgrade to 2.0. See :doc:`/release_notes/2.0`

Limitations and warnings
--------------------------

* The usual limitations on retraining models and regenerating API node packages apply (see :doc:`/installation/custom/upgrade` for more information). Note that DSS 3.1 includes a vast overhaul of the machine learning part, so machine learning models trained with previous DSS will not work in DSS 3.1

===============================

DSS 3.1.0 is a major upgrade to DSS with exciting new features.

For a summary of the major new features, see: https://www.dataiku.com/learn/whatsnew

New features
-------------

Scala recipe and notebook
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

You can now interact with Spark using Scala, the most native language for Spark processing.

This release brings to DSS:

* Spark-Scala recipes
* Spark-Scala notebooks
* Custom recipes (plugins) written in Scala

For more information, please see :doc:`/code_recipes/scala`

H2O integration (through Sparkling-Water)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

`H2O <http://h2o.ai>`_ is a distributed machine-learning library, with a wide range of algorithms and methods.

DSS now includes full support for H2O (in its "Sparkling Water" variant) in its visual machine learning interface.

.. Document seems missing
    For more information, please see :doc:`/machine-learning/algorithms/sparkling-water`

Advanced users can also leverage H2O through all Spark-based recipes and notebooks of DSS.

New DSS home page & workflow
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The DSS home page now features:

* The ability to set a customizable "status" to projects, in order to materialize your workflow (draft, production, archived, ...) in DSS
* The ability to filter projects by tags, status, owner, ...
* The ability to sort projects
* A new "list" view with advanced details (contents of the project, activity monitoring, ...)
* A new "flow" view to study the dependencies between projects
* Useful "Tips and Tricks"

Navigator
%%%%%%%%%%

Boost your productivity ! You can now very quickly navigate from a DSS object to another (from recipe to dataset to another recipe to model to analysis ...).

Hit Shift+A on any screen to enter the navigator.

Prebuilt notebooks
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

You can now use prebuilt templates for notebooks when creating a notebook from a dataset. This allows for reusable interactive analysis

DSS 3.1 comes with 4 prebuilt notebooks for analyzing datasets:

* PCA
* Correlations between variables
* Time series visualization and analytics
* Time series forecasting

New data sources
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

DSS can now connect to the following SQL databases

* :doc:`/connecting/sql/netezza`
* :doc:`/connecting/sql/saphana`
* :doc:`/connecting/sql/bigquery` (Read only)
* :doc:`Microsoft Azure DWH </connecting/sql/sqlserver>`

Machine learning visualizations
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

DSS now includes the following new visualizations in Machine Learning

* Decision tree(s) visualization for Decision Tree, Random Forests and Gradient Boosting
* Partial dependency plots for Gradient Boosting

More custom algorithms support
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Custom algorithms are now supported in:

* Python Clustering (Python)
* Spark MLLib Prediction (Scala)
* Spark MLLib Clustering (Scala)

Custom Formats and Export
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

A brand new export mechanism has been introduced. It provides easier configuration and expands what can be supported.

It is now possible to write custom format extractors and exporters, either in Python or Java. See our plugins library for examples.

This notably provides a much improved support for export to Tableau (TDE files or Tableau Server): open any data from DSS in Tableau in just 2 clicks!

Other notable enhancements
--------------------------

Data preparation
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

* New processor: date filter
* New processor: compute distance between geopoints

Machine learning
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

* Handling of data types has been strongly overhauled, resulting in better reliability in machine learning
* Additional algorithms have been added in Spark MLLib
* DSS now supports clustering in the Spark MLLib implementation
* You can now export variables importance and coefficients data directly from the machine learning UI
* When doing dummy-encoding, DSS can now remove the last dummy to avoid collinearity (especially useful for regression models). DSS by default automatically uses the proper behavior according to the algorithm.
* When doing dummy-encoding, DSS has more options for handling features with large cardinalities (clip above a number of dummies, clip after a cumulative distribution, clip below a threshold in number of records)
* Much faster scoring in MLLib multiclass
* In scoring recipe, it is now possible to select the input columns to retain in output
* In scoring recipe, it is now possible to "unplug" the output schema from the input. This is especially useful in corner cases where the data type is incorrect
* Added support for in-database machine learning on Vertica, through Vertica 7 Advanced Analytics package
* Added links to original analysis from training recipe & saved models

Visual recipes
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

* The join recipe now has support for more join types: Inner, Left, Right, Outer, Cross, Natural and Advanced (left with optional dedup)
* The join recipe now has support for various kinds of inequality joins

Datasets & formats
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

* Very large Excel files can now be opened with small memory overhead
* New option for CSV and SQL: normalize doubles (ie: always add .0 to doubles). This makes operation between doubles and integers generally more reliable
* Add support for newer AWS S3 regions (like eu-central-1)

Automation (scenarios, bundles, metrics, checks)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

* Counting records on small datasets will not use Hive anymore
* Custom checks (in a plugin) can now be used

Hadoop & Spark
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

* It is now possible to import Hive tables as HDFS datasets from the DSS UI
* You can now validate SparkSQL recipes without having to run them

Installation and setup
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

* The most standard Java options can now be set directly from the install.ini file. See :doc:`/installation/custom/advanced-java-customization`
* DSS can now use Conda for managing its internal Python environment instead of virtualenv/pip
* Enhanced the content of DSS diagnosis reports

Misc
%%%%%%

* You can now expose a folder or a file in a folder on the Dashboard
* Error handling has been improved in numerous places. DSS will now more prominently display the actual errors, especially when using code recipes
* DSS now includes a public API for interacting with recipes
* New interaction features in plugins
* The schema of a dataset can be exported (to any supported formatter) from the settings screen
* Access to datasets from Python and R is much faster, especially for small datasets
* SQL connectors can now use custom JDBC URLs for advanced customization
* Custom variables are now available in Webapps
* New default pictures for users
* Lots of performance improvements, both in the backend and frontend

Notable bug fixes
-------------------

* Very large Excel files can now be opened with small memory overhead
* Machine Learning: Imputation with Unicode values has been fixed
* Visual preparation: much faster drag & drop with Firefox
* Fixed a bunch of JS errors
* Visual recipes running on Hive or Impala will properly take into account the case-insensitivity of these DBs and not generate case-mismatched Parquet files anymore
* Fixed possible job failures in Kerberos-secured clusters
* Add multi-schema support to S3 -> Redshift syncing
* Don't forget to clear a dataset before doing a redispatch-sync
* Switched to CartoDB tiles for maps
