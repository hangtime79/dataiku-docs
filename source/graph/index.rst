Graph
########

Graph data structure natively represents relationships between data. The two main parts of a graph are:

- Vertices (or nodes) that represent objects and their properties

- Edges (or connections) that represent links between two vertices

Some of the key benefits are:

- **Enhanced Data Relationships & Insights**

  - Unlike traditional tabular data analysis, graph analytics enables users to explore intricate relationships between data points, providing a holistic view of connections and dependencies.

- **Identify unusual connections**

  - Graph analytics is particularly effective in identifying fraudulent activities by detecting unusual patterns, anomalies, and suspicious connections in financial transactions, cybersecurity, and compliance monitoring.

- **Faster query processing**

  - Graph analytics fundamentally changes the way relationships are queried and analyzed. By eliminating the need for expensive join operations and enabling high-speed relationship traversal, graph databases significantly outperform relational databases for complex, connected data.
