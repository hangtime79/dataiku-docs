**Visual Graph** is a complete framework for building graphs from your tabular datasets. It allows you to iteratively design and refine a graph schema, then makes the resulting graph accessible for deep exploration via a dedicated interface, large-scale processing with recipes, and as a knowledge source for AI agents.
