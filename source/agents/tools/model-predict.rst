###################

This tool predicts record using a Dataiku Machine Learning prediction model.

This tool allows you to create powerful composition of traditional Machine Learning and Generative AI.

This tool takes a single argument: a Saved Model. For more information, see :doc:`/machine-learning/index`

This tool requires classical prediction/regression AutoML models that are compatible with "Optimized Scoring". See :doc:`/machine-learning/scoring-engines` for more details.
