Managed tools
##############

Dataiku includes a complete system for managing tools. Dataiku provides many kinds of tools that are built into the platform, and provides extensibility for users to add their own kinds of tools.

The tools managed by Dataiku include security, audit, and most can be configured visually, allowing you to focus on building your Generative AI Application rather than the plumbing of tools.

Tools are created by clicking on the Generative AI Menu (pink graph) then "Agent Tools".
