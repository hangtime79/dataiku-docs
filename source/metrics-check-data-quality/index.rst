Metrics, checks and Data Quality
################################


Metrics allow you to automate computation of various measurements on flow items (datasets, managed folders, saved models and model evaluation stores).
You can use Checks to assert whether metric values meet certain conditions.

Data Quality rules are an improvement over the check mechanism for datasets.
They allow you to define expectations on a dataset's contents in a single step and
also provide different views to monitor and analyze data quality issues across datasets, projects, and the full Dataiku instance.
