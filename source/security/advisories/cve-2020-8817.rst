######################################################

Information
=============

* CVE Id: CVE-2020-8817
* CVSS Base Score: 4.3

Summary
========

The "Created by" metadata displayed in the right column for most Dataiku object types
(datasets, Wiki articles, dashboards, ...) can be tampered with by users with
write access to the project.

Although the audit trail and history log always reference the proper information, this allows
hostile attackers to display misleading metadata information in the right column.

Mitigation
===========

Dataiku DSS 6.0.5 has been made available to customers to remediate this issue.
