Images
########

Some common tasks when working with images include: feature extraction, classification, image segmentation, object recognition...

Dataiku natively integrates the following capabilities:

* :doc:`Computer vision in Visual ML </machine-learning/computer-vision/index>`: Perform `image classification <https://knowledge.dataiku.com/latest/ml-analytics/images/classification-visual/tutorial-index.html>`_ and object detection in a visual way, no code needed.
* :doc:`Deep learning in Visual ML </machine-learning/deep-learning/index>`: Build deep learning models in Keras in a semi-visual way.

In addition, you can leverage any image processing library with Python or R code in Dataiku.
