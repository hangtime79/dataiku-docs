NLP with Crowlingo API
#######################

Dataiku used to be able to leverage the Crowlingo Multilingual NLP API for language detection, sentiment analysis, summarization and `multiple other tasks <https://crowlingo.com/docs/>`_", "`102 languages <https://crowlingo.com/details/>`_.

This capability was provided by the "Crowlingo Multilingual NLP" plugin, which has been removed as of DSS 14.

We recommend looking into :doc:`/nlp/index` for alternatives.
