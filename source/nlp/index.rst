Text & Natural Language Processing
####################################

A large amount of information is available in the form of text. For example, tweets, emails, survey responses, product reviews and so forth contain information that is written in natural language.

The goal of working with text is to convert it into data that can be useful for analysis. Some applications of text analysis include: sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, summarization, and so forth.

DSS provides numerous NLP capabilities, either through native processing, through locally-running models, or leveraging third party APIs.

In addition, many NLP capabilities can now be more efficiently performed using LLMs. Please see :doc:`/generative-ai/index` for more details.
