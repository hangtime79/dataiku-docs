Interactive statistics
############################

An interactive statistics worksheet in Dataiku DSS provides a dedicated interface for performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on datasets. Using this feature, you can:

* Summarize or describe data samples, e.g. using univariate analysis, bivariate analysis, distribution & curve fitting, and correlation matrices. This falls under the area of `descriptive statistics <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_statistics>`_.
* Draw conclusions from a sample dataset about an underlying population, e.g. using hypothesis testing. This falls under the area of `inferential statistics <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_inference>`_.
* Visualize the structure of the dataset in a reduced number of dimensions, using principal component analysis. This falls under the area of `dimensionality reduction <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction>`_.

This section of the reference documentation covers the DSS **Worksheet** and performing EDA tasks in DSS.
