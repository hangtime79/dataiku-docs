A Dataiku DSS project is a container for all your work on a particular activity.

Each project has a single :doc:`Flow </flow/index>` that shows the pipeline of datasets and recipes associated with the project.

The project home acts as the command center from which you can see the overall status of a project,
view recent activity, and collaborate through comments, tags, and a project to-do list.
It is also where the project's **Actions** menu resides.  From the **Actions** menu, you can:

- :doc:`Duplicate <duplicate>` a project
- Export a project to a ZIP file
- Delete a project

The ``...`` (more actions) menu on the project page provides access to the **Application Designer**, where you can create a :doc:`Project Setup <project-setup>` workflow for your project. Through the Application Designer's advanced options, you can create guided setup actions that help users configure duplicated versions of your project.
