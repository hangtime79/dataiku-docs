Landing page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The landing page is meant to give you quick access to the resources you are most likely to use, divided in two main sections:

- the objects you are most likely to access. Depending on your profile and authorizations, this section will give you access to:

    - projects, recently visited and favorite items if you have access to them
    - workspaces otherwise

- Global resources, which may include:

    - Instance promoted content (Admin messages, links, data collections, wiki articles, projects, workspaces, web-app, Dataiku app, or app instances promoted by the instance administrators)
    - Tutorials for Dataiku's feature you may be interested in
    - Links to other external resources like demos, Dataiku reference documentation, ...

Managing promoted content
=========================

.. _managing-promoted-content:

Instance administrators can add or remove promoted content from the *Administration -> Settings -> Homepage* page.

In the `Promoted content` section, you can add new content, edit existing content, and re-order it.

.. note::
  Note that promoting a content doesn't affect its access authorization. Only users who are able to see the promoted items will be able to see them in the homepage.
