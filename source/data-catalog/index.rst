Data Catalog
############

The **Data Catalog** is a central place for analysts, data scientists, and other collaborators to share and search for datasets across their organization. 

From the Data Catalog homepage, which you can find in the Applications menu on the top right, you can search for data in four categories:

* Data Collections: manually curated list of relevant datasets
* Most Used Datasets: datasets that are automatically considered the most relevant for publication or reuse
* Connections Explorer: directly browse connections
* Datasets & Indexed Tables: browse the list of datasets across all accessible Dataiku projects


The Data Catalog can be accessed from the Application menu, or from a project using the "Search and import" option of the new dataset menu (other options can bring you directly to a sub-section of the catalog).
