Data Collections
################

In **Data Collections**, you can find curated groups of datasets, view information about those datasets, and reuse them in your own projects.
Click on any dataset in a collection to view its details, status, and schema.
From here, you can also explore, publish, export, watch, mark the dataset as a favorite, or preview its content.

Users with relevant permissions can publish datasets to a Data Collection from the Flow or from another Data Collection.
Other users can then browse collections to find relevant datasets, read the documentation, and add datasets to their projects straight from the collection.
