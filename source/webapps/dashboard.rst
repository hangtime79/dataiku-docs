Publishing webapps on the dashboard
####################################

Once you have created your webapp, you can publish it on the DSS dashboard, by clicking on "Actions > Publish".

This creates an insight of type "webapp" and adds it to the selected dashboard(s).

The dashboard always shows the latest version of the webapp (if you save the webapp, the dashboard will be updated immediately).
