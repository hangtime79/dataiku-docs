Dashboards
###########

Dashboards allow you to share elements of your data project, either with other analysts working on the project, or with users who don't have full access to the project.

This section details reference material about dashboards. We recommend that you have a look at DSS sample projects and `the public DSS gallery <https://www.dataiku.com/dss/samples>`_ to get familiar with what dashboards can do.
