Installing and setting up
#########################

There are three main ways to setup Dataiku DSS.


* **Dataiku Cloud**: Dataiku provides free trials and paying hosted plans on its own cloud. Data and compute are hosted by Dataiku.

* **Dataiku Cloud Stacks**: Deploy a fully-managed Dataiku setup on a cloud provider. The setup comes fully-featured with Elastic AI, advanced security, R support, auto-healing setup... Everything is deployed in your cloud tenant, Dataiku does not have access to your data. This is the recommended setup for deploying on a cloud provider in your tenant. Supported cloud providers are:

   * Amazon Web Services (AWS)
   * Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
   * Microsoft Azure


* **Custom Dataiku**: Download and install Dataiku DSS on your own Linux server. This can be deployed either on-premises or on any cloud. Use this setup if you cannot use Dataiku Cloud or Dataiku Cloud Stacks
