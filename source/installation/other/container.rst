Running DSS as a container (in Docker or Kubernetes)
#####################################################

.. warning::

	Running DSS inside a container is a relatively complex setup. It requires good familiarity
	with building and running container images, notably familarity with writing Dockerfiles.

	Running DSS itself as a container (either by running Docker directly, or through Kubernetes)
	is generally speaking incompatible with the ability to leverage containers as a processing engine.
	See :doc:`/containers/index`. While some things are possible, it requires high expertise with
	networking and image building capabilities.

	We do not recommend running DSS inside a container without discussing first with your Dataiku Account Manager
	or Customer Success Manager.
