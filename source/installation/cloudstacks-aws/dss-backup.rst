Backup and restore of DSS instances
####################################


Manual snapshots
====================

You can manually backup your instance at any time by clicking on **New snapshot** in the **Snapshots** tab of the instance. It
is not required to stop or deprovision the instance to make a snapshot. It has no impact the the instance users.

Automated snaphots
====================

You can enable automated snapshots in the **Settings** tab of the instance. Once enabled, FM will create snapshots at the required
frequency and delete old snapshots if required, by specifying a maximum number of snapshots.
