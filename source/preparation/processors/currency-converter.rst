Convert currencies
#############################################

This processor converts a column with monetary data from one currency to
another.

It supports around 40 currencies with historical data

Input currency
==============

The processor can either use a constant input currency, or read a
different input currency from a dedicated column. This can be used to
'realign' different input currencies to a single output

Output currency
===============

The processor outputs all output in the same currency

Reference date
==============

The processor includes historical data for the currencies. You can
either set the conversion to a fixed date, or use a Date-typed column to
use a different reference date for each row
