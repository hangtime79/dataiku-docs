Filter rows/cells with formula
#############################################

Filter rows from the dataset based on the result of a formula. Alternatively, clear content from matching cells rather than filter the rows.

The row/cell matches if the result of the formula is considered as "truish," which includes:

* A true boolean

* A number (integer or decimal) that is not 0

* The string "true"
