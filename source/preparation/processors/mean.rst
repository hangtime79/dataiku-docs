Compute the average of numerical values
#############################################

This processor computes the line by line arithmetical mean (average) of a set of numeric columns.

For a given line, empty columns will be ignored, the mean will be calculated only over the non-empty columns.
If all columns are empty, the result will be either an empty cell or a default value defined in the processor options.

Columns selection
=================

This processor can compute the mean over multiple columns:

-  An explicit list of columns
-  All columns matching a given pattern

Examples
========

-  Mean of ``[1, 2, 3]`` will be ``2``
-  Mean of ``[1, 2, ""]`` will be ``1.5`` (the empty cell is ignored)
-  Mean of ``["", ""]`` will be an empty cell or the default value, depending on the processor options.

Note that the processor doesn't support non-numeric values: Mean of ``[1, 2, "some text"]`` may yield an error when the recipe runs, depending on the execution environment.
