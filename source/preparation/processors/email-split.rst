Split e-mail addresses
#############################################

Split an e-mail address into two parts: the local part (before the @) and the domain (after the @). 

This processor generates two output columns, prefixed by the input column name. If the input doesn’t contain a valid email address, the processor will not produce an output value.

Example
==========

From the input column ``email`` two output columns are created: ``email_localpart`` and ``email_domain``. The ``email`` column also is preserved in the output dataset.

Input ``myemail@domain.com`` becomes two values: ``myemail`` and ``domain.com``.
