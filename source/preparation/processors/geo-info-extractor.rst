Extract from geo column
#############################################

This processor extracts data from a geometry column.

Extracts:

-  Centroid point
-  Length (if input is not a point)
-  Area (if input is a polygon)

Warning: Length and area are expressed in the unit of the CRS, so often
in degrees instead of meters.
