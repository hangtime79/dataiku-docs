Simplify text
#############################################

Perform various simplifications on a text column.

Options
=========

* **Normalize text**: Transform to lowercase, remove punctuation and accents and perform Unicode NFD normalization (``Café`` -> ``cafe``).

* **Stem words:** Transform each word into its "stem", i.e. its grammatical root. For example, ``grammatical`` is transformed to ``grammat``. This transformation is language-specific.

* **Clear stop words**: Remove so-called "stop words" (``the``, ``I``, ``a``, ``of``, ...). This transformation is language-specific.

* **Sort words alphabetically:** Sorts all words of the text. For example, ``the small dog`` is transformed to ``dog small the``, allowing strings containing the same words in different order to be matched.

.. note::  
   Other processors with text operation — tokenization, n-gram extraction, fuzzy join — benefit from built-in text simplification options. You do not need to perform text simplification separately prior to using them.
