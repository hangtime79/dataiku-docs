Group long-tail values
#############################################

This processor merges together all values of a column that are not part
of an allow-list of values that should not be merged.

Use case
========

The main use case of this processor is to merge all values of a column
except the most frequent ones. The merged values are replaced by a
generic 'Others' value.
