Split and unfold
#############################################

This processor splits the values of a column based on a separator and
transforms them into several binary columns. Also called
'dummification'.

You can prefix new columns by filling the "Prefix" option.

You can choose the maximum number of columns to create with the "Max nb. columns to create" option.
