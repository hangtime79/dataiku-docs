Installing Python packages
###########################

Any Python package can be used in DSS. There is no restriction to which package can be installed and used.

The recommended way to install your own Python packages is to install them in a :doc:`code environment </code-envs/index>`.

Additional prerequisites
=========================

Some Python packages may require additional system dependencies if they include native code.
In particular, you may need to install system development tools, the development package for the Python interpreter itself, and additional development libraries.

If you get an error when installing a Python package, please refer to :doc:`code environment troubleshooting </code-envs/troubleshooting>`.


Installing in a specific code environment (recommended)
