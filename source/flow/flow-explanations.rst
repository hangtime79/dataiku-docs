Flow explanations
#################

Dataiku includes an AI assistant to generate explanations of project Flows. 

Please see :doc:`/ai-assistants/ai-explain` for more details.

Generating project Flow explanations
====================================

* On the Flow screen open the **Flow Actions** menu
* Select **Explain Flow**

Generating Flow zone explanations
=================================

* On the Flow screen select a zone
* Select the **Actions** tab in the right-hand side panel
* Click **Explain**

.. note::

	You can generate explanations of project Flows which do not use zones
	or you can generate explanations of Flow zones. It is currently not
	possible to generate explanations of Flows with zones.

Explanation options
=====================

It is possible to adjust the generated explanations using these options:

* Language: the natural language of the explanation
* Purpose: the intended audience of the explanation
* Length: the verbosity of the explanation

If editing a project or a Flow zone long description you can also choose to let
the AI Explain feature generate it and then save it.

.. note::

	The explanations are AI-generated and as such are subject to errors.
