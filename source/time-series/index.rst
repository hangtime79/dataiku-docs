Time Series
################

Time series use a sequence of time-ordered data points to represent how a measurement changes with time. A time series can record measurements of events, processes, systems, and so forth.

You can analyze time series by extracting meaningful statistics, charts, and other attributes from the data. You can also forecast or predict future values in a time series, based on previous observations.

Use-cases for time series analysis and prediction include: forecasting of quarterly sales and profits, weather forecasting, trend detection, and so forth.
