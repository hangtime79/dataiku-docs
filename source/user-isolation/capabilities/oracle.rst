	:local:

It is possible to configure the Oracle DSS connection to authenticate to the database using one Oracle account, and perform
all data manipulation and SQL queries using another. This typically allows DSS to impersonate its end-users when accessing the
database.

See :doc:`/connecting/sql/oracle` for more details.
