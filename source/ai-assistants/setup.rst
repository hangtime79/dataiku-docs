Most Dataiku AI Assistants are provided by *Dataiku AI Services* and require that the Dataiku DSS server be connected to Internet, in order to talk to our AI Services.

Using the Dataiku AI Services is subject to acceptance of our Dataiku AI Services Terms of Use, which are linked from the "AI Assistants" page.

The Dataiku Code Assistant is an exception. It is based on the Dataiku LLM Mesh and fully under your control. Dataiku does not see your data for the Code Assistant.

In order to enable AI Assistants, you must go to Admin > Settings > AI Assistants and enable the relevant assistants.
