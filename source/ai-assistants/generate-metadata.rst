When selecting a dataset, the feature is accessible from the right hand panel. Use the button "Generate Metadata" from the details or the schema tab.

By default, the assistant generates a short description, a long description, and a description for each column in english. 

You can also choose another language from the top left dropdown menu. Available languages are the following:

For each description, you can approve or edit the generated descriptions. At the end clicking "Approve and use as description" will save the descriptions that you have approved.
