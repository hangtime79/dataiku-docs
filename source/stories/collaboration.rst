Annotations and comments
========================
Dataiku Stories offers comments and annotations. Both can be created by the users in presentation mode and are key features for making the Dataiku Stories truly a “collaborative place” on data:

- The comments can include a filter so that when a user selects the comment the presentation will be filtered providing the right context for the explanation.
- The annotations are a kind of a “Marker” that can be defined on a chart and can be used to draw the attention of users on a specific metric.

Exports
=======
With a focus on collaboration and sharing outcomes, it is feasible to export the presentation in various formats:

 - PDF and PPT format
 - ZIP format : After creating a presentation, it is possible to export and import the presentation in the same or different workspace.
