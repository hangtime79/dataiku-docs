Creating static insights
#########################

In DSS code recipes and notebooks, you can create static insights: data files that are created by code and that can be rendered on the dashboard.

This capability can notably be used to embed in one click charts created using:

* :doc:`ggplot2 </R/ggplot2>`
* :doc:`dygraphs </R/dygraphs>`
* :doc:`ggvis </R/ggvis>`
* :doc:`googleVis </R/googlevis>`

You can also use it for embedding in the dashboard any kind of content (image, HTML, ...)

The API reference for creating insights in R can be found in the documentation of the ``dataiku`` package: |R_dataiku_api_doc_url|
