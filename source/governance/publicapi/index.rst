Public API
##########

The Dataiku Govern public API allows you to interact with Govern from any external system. It allows you to perform a large variety of administration and maintenance operations, in addition to access to items and other data managed by Dataiku Govern.

The Dataiku Govern public API is available:

 * As a :doc:`Python API client <devguide:concepts-and-examples/govern/index>`. This allows you to easily send commands to the public API from a Python program. This is the recommended way to interact with the API.

 * As an :doc:`HTTP REST API <rest>`. This lets you interact with Dataiku Govern from any program that can send an HTTP request. This requires more work.


Example usage of the Python client can be found :doc:`in the Developer Guide <devguide:concepts-and-examples/govern/govern-client>`.
