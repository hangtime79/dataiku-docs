DSS in the cloud
#################

DSS can run fully in the cloud.

When running in the cloud, DSS features advanced integrations with the managed services of the cloud providers, allowing deployment of complex architectures in a fully managed fashion.

DSS has advanced support for:

* :doc:`Amazon Web Services (AWS) <aws/index>`
* :doc:`Microsoft Azure <azure/index>`
* :doc:`Google Cloud Platform (GCP) <gcp/index>`

This section documents the various integration points, and provides some reference architectures for fully-managed cloud services
