The lineage graph can be exported to PDF or image (PNG, JPG) files in order to share a snapshot of lineage details within your organization more easily.

Setup
=====

The graphics export feature must be setup before lineage can be exported.

Follow :doc:`/installation/custom/graphics-export` to enable the export feature on your DSS instance.


Manual usage
============

In the Data Lineage view, click "EXPORT" at the bottom.

Settings
========

Files generated are fully customizable. The following parameters are available:

- File type, to select the type of files to generate (PDF, PNG or JPEG).
- Export format, to determine image dimensions.

	- If a standard format (A4 or US Letter) is chosen, image dimensions will be calculated based on the size of your lineage graph and the chosen orientation (Landscape or Portrait). On the contrary, Custom format allows you to configure a custom width and height.
