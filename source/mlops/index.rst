MLOps
######

Dataiku offers numerous capabilities for implementing a complete MLOps practice:

* :doc:`The Flow </flow/index>` offers full lineage and traceability on the design on models
* :doc:`Deploying projects to production with full CI/CD capabilities </deployment/index>`
* :doc:`Visual Machine Learning </machine-learning/index>`
* :doc:`Real-time REST API scoring server with versioning </apinode/index>`
* :doc:`Exporting models to Python, Java, MLflow and PMML for scoring outside of DSS </machine-learning/models-export>`
* :doc:`Comparing models, models versions and behavior of models over time </mlops/model-comparisons/index>`
* :doc:`Performing advanced drift analysis </mlops/drift-analysis/index>`
* :doc:`Test scenarios </scenarios/test_scenarios>` provide the ability to test parts of a project flow, webapps and run Python unit tests.

This section focuses on the following MLOps-specific capabilities:

* Curating features in a Feature Store
* Evaluating and comparing models and model versions
* Analyzing drift
* Importing models from external Machine Learning systems
* Tracking code experiments
* Monitoring projects, endpoints and models health
* Checking Project Standards
* Compute AI Types
