Using MLflow models in DSS
############################

Scoring
==============

:ref:`Scoring recipe <explanations_scoring_recipe_label>` is available for MLflow saved models.

Two modes are available for scoring with an MLflow Saved Model:

1. Direct output mode where DSS outputs directly what the MLflow model outputs.
2. Restructure mode where DSS tries to interpret the model output.


Evaluation
==========

You can evaluate versions of MLflow Saved Models on any valid DSS dataset. Related functionalities are available:

* Performance analysis
* :doc:`Model Evaluation Store </mlops/model-evaluations/index>`
* :doc:`Model Comparison </mlops/model-comparisons/index>`
