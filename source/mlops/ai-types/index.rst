AI Types
########

AI Types help organizations quickly identify contents of a project or a service. They simplify management and governance,
allowing for the creation of more specific filters, Unified Monitoring alerts (see :doc:`/mlops/unified-monitoring/unified-monitoring-alerting` doc)
and Deployers Hooks (see :doc:`/deployment/project-deployment-infrastructures` doc).

They are automatically assigned based on a set of rules and can also be manually granted.
