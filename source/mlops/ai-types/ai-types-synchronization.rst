AI Types Synchronization
########################

Synchronization with Govern
===========================
When a project or bundle is synchronized with Govern, its AI Types are automatically included in the synchronization data.
If an AI Type is later updated on the DSS instance, the new value is automatically pushed to Govern.


Manual Refresh
==============

AI Types can be manually refreshed. In the Project Settings' AI Types tab, users with write permissions on the project
can independently recompute all the AI Types of the project and of its API Services.
