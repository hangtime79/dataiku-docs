Clustering (Unsupervised ML)
#############################

Clustering (aka unsupervised machine learning) is used to understand the structure of your data. For instance, you could group customers into clusters based on their payment history, which could be used to guide sales strategies.

.. note::
   Unlike supervised machine learning, you don't need a **target** to conduct unsupervised machine learning
