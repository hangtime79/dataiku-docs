Writing custom models
#####################

DSS does not restrict you to the algorithms that are part of its visual ML capabilities, but allows you to code your own model, either in Python or in Scala.

- For more information on creating custom models, see :ref:`Custom Models <custom.models>`.
- To make a plugin out of a custom model, see :doc:`/plugins/reference/prediction-algorithms`.
- To create a custom model to train with the MLlib backend, see :doc:`algorithms/mllib`. (Deprecated)
- To create a custom model using MLflow Model, see :doc:`/mlops/mlflow-models/index`.
