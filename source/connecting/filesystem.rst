You can create datasets based on files located on the DSS server itself.

Filesystem connection
======================

Filesystem datasets are based on a Filesystem connection, which includes a "root path" for this connection. All datasets created in this connection are located within this root path.

Filesystem connections can only be created and managed by DSS administrators.

Create a filesystem dataset
=============================

From either the Flow or the datasets list, click on New dataset > Server filesystem.

Select the connection in which your files are located, then click on "Browse" to locate your files.
