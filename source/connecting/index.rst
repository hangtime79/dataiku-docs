Connecting to data
##################

The first task when using Data Science Studio is to define *datasets* to connect to your data sources.

A dataset is a series of records with the same schema. It is quite analogous to a table in the SQL world.

For a more global explanation about the different kinds of datasets, see the :doc:`../concepts/index` page.
