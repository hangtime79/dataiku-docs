Dataset plugins
################

:doc:`DSS plugins </plugins/index>` can provide new kinds of datasets. When you install a DSS plugin which contains a new dataset kind, it automatically appears in the "New dataset" menus or pages.

You can browse existing plugins from Administration > Plugins, or from https://www.dataiku.com/dss/plugins.

You can also write your own plugin in Python to connect to a new kind of data source. See :doc:`/plugins/index` for more information about writing DSS plugins.
