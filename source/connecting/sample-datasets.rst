Sample Dataset
################

Sample datasets are a kind of :doc:`DSS plugins </plugins/index>`. Those are small ready-to-use datasets that can
be added freely in a project to kickstart it.

When you install a DSS plugin which contains a new sample dataset, it automatically appears in the "New dataset"
menus or pages, as well as in the "Empty flow" default page.

You can browse existing sample dataset plugins from Administration > Plugins.

You can also write your own sample dataset plugin to add your personalized datasets. See :doc:`/plugins/index` for
more information about writing DSS plugins or see :doc:`/plugins/reference/samples` for more information about writing Sample dataset plugins.
