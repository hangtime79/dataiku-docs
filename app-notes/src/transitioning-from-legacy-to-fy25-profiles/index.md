# Transitioning from legacy to FY25 profiles (Fiscal Year 2025)

New user profiles were introduced during Fiscal Year 2025. The following section explains how they compare to the [legacy user profiles](https://doc.dataiku.com/dss/latest/security/user-profiles.html). 

- **Full Designer**: **Full Designers** have full access to all Dataiku features. They have access to the same functionalities as the legacy **Designer** profile. 
- **Advanced Analytics Designer**: **Advanced Analytics Designers** have access to similar functionalities as the legacy **Designer** profile, except they cannot access the most advanced coding, machine learning and ML ops features. 
- **Data Designer**: **Data Designers** can prepare data and build automated data pipelines, similar to the legacy **Designer** profile. They can run SQL queries in recipes or notebooks. However, unlike the legacy **Designer** profile, they do not have access to machine learning and ML ops capabilities and cannot code in Python.
- **Governance Manager**: **Governance Managers** can view workflows, dashboards, and WebApps, like the legacy **Reader** profile. Unlike **Readers**, they can govern projects and other inputs to validate outputs and authorize deployment.
- **Technical Account**: **Technical Accounts** can manage the platform and troubleshoot. They have the same capabilities as the former **Platform Admin** profile.
- **AI Consumer**: **AI Consumers** can read the content of projects but cannot modify them, like the legacy **Reader** profile. Unlike **Readers**, they can consume Generative AI applications built and distributed through Dataiku and run [Dataiku applications](https://doc.dataiku.com/dss/latest/applications/index.html).
